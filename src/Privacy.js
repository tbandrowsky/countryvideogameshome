      We don't give a doodoo about your life.  We just want money.
      </h2>
      <p>
      Now, we don't want your money so bad that we're going to ship you some piece of doodoo spyware. 
      We don't want your money so bad that we'd t mine your stuff to 
      send it off to some AI sales guy.  
      We don't want it so bad we'll start showing bulldoodoo links 
      to other people's stuff and maybe worst of all to more piece of doodoo spyware.  
      </p>
      <p>
      We just don't collected your data and we don't ship spy stuff to collect it.
      </p>
      <p>
      So if I may say in my Willie Otis way, we don't really give a doodoo about your doodoo because we've got enough doodoo of our own.  
      For real, Ma's truck broke down.  Tranny.  As soon as we get some of the cash coming in that piece of one fine great used vehicle will 
      be headed towards a great dealer nearest you!</p>
      <p>We get money from people that buy our stuff.  We're woke enough to know that 
      anything that creeps and crawls and towers and soars is all the same when they all each hold a 10 spot.  Know that, 
      everyone that gives us that 10 spot for our latest product can be rest assured that we will remember you reverently!
      </p>
      <p>
      Right now, our product is just a fun game, and we'd appreciate it if you could be 
      so kind as to give us a go.  We just want you to be entertained, with no strings attached.
      </p>
      <p>
      Thank you in advance for your kind consideration,
      </p>
